# Walkthrough of Gravity Potentials and Solitonic Approaches

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for modeling gravitational potentials using solitonic solutions and comparing them with classical Newtonian and general relativistic models. The purpose of this framework is to explore solitonic solutions as potential representations of gravitational fields and to analyze their behavior in comparison to established gravitational theories.

### Key Concepts:

1. Solitonic Gravity Potentials: A novel approach that models gravitational fields using solitonic solutions, which exhibit localized wave-like behaviors. These solutions are compared to classical Newtonian and general relativistic potentials.

2. Energy and Force Field Comparisons: The scripts compute and compare the energy and force fields of solitonic potentials with Newtonian potentials. This comparison provides insight into how solitonic models influence gravitational behavior.

3. Curvature Proxies: The code includes calculations for curvature proxies, which approximate the curvature of spacetime. These proxies are derived from gradients of the gravitational potential and provide a simplified measure of gravitational effects.

4. Numerical Methods: Various numerical techniques are used to approximate solutions for gravitational fields, including gradient calculations for force fields and the computation of energy integrals. The results are visualized using contour plots to highlight differences between solitonic and classical models.

This repository provides an exploratory framework for investigating solitonic gravitational models and can serve as a foundation for further research into alternative gravitational theories.

## Structure

The repository includes the following components:

# `gravity_potentials.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the entire process. It covers the setup of solitonic potentials, their gradients, energy calculations, and visual comparisons with Newtonian and general relativistic models.
  
# `potential_comparisons.py`: Python script that computes energy, force, and curvature proxies for gravitational potentials, providing the necessary functions for the notebook.

# `plots/`**: A directory containing visualizations that compare the gravitational fields and curvature proxies of solitonic and classical models.

## Key Functions

### `calculate_gravity_potential()`
This function calculates the gravitational potential for both solitonic and Newtonian models. It takes in a grid of spatial points and returns the potential field at each point.

### `compute_curvature_proxy()`
This function computes a **curvature proxy** by calculating the **gradient of the gravitational potential**. This scalar measure approximates how the gravitational field behaves, and is used for comparing solitonic and general relativistic models.

### `plot_curvature_comparison()`
Generates contour plots to visually compare the curvature proxies of solitonic and general relativistic models. The curvature is calculated using a proxy derived from the potential gradients.

### `overlap_integral()`
Calculates the **overlap integral** between the solitonic and Newtonian or general relativistic potentials. This integral quantifies how closely the solitonic model approximates the classical models.

# Example:
# Solitonic Model Parameters
# The solitonic model is based on wavefunctions that combine bright solitons and a dark soliton, and these are derived with the following parameters:
#
#A1, A2: Amplitudes for the two bright solitons.
#
#w1, w2: Widths of the two bright solitons.
#
#A_dark: Amplitude of the dark soliton (with negative values to create a "dip" in the potential).
#
#w_dark: Width of the dark soliton.
#
#The bright solitons are modeled using the hyperbolic cosine function (np.cosh), and the dark soliton is modeled using the hyperbolic tangent function (np.tanh). The total solitonic wavefunction is a sum of these three components, which are normalized to create a consistent total probability distribution.
#
# Construct solitonic wavefunctions
#psi_bright_1 = A1 * np.cosh(np.sqrt((x - 1.0)**2 + (y - 1.0)**2) / w1)**-1 * np.exp(1j * 1.2 * z)
#psi_bright_2 = A2 * np.cosh(np.sqrt((x + 1.5)**2 + (y + 1.5)**2) / w2)**-1 * np.exp(1j * 0.8 * z)
#psi_dark = A_dark * np.tanh(np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) / w_dark)
#Gravitational Field Calculation:
#
#Gravitational Field Calculation:
#The effective potential is computed from the probability density of the solitonic wavefunction:
#V_solitonic = -np.abs(psi_beta_3D)**2
#
#The gravitational field is calculated by computing the gradient of the potential:
#gx_solitonic, gy_solitonic, gz_solitonic = np.gradient(V_solitonic, X[1] - X[0], Y[1] - Y[0], Z[1] - Z[0])
#
#
#Energy and Overlap Integral:
#The total energy of the solitonic and Newtonian potentials is calculated by summing the potentials.
#
#The overlap integral quantifies the similarity between the solitonic and Newtonian potentials:
#overlap_integral = np.sum(V_solitonic * V_newtonian)
